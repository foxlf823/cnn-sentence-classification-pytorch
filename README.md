# A PyTorch implement of CNN sentence classification

This code implements the models described in the paper "[Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882)". We refer to [its tensorflow implement](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf). 

I simplified some features from its tensorflow implement, and it is an easy example for studying Pytorch, CNN and NLP. Just run "train.py" and nothing else needs to be done. [Movie Review data](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/) is used and 10% data are split as the evaluation set.

Requirements

* Python 2.7
* PyTorch 0.3
